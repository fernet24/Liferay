# Liferay

The LiferayChallenge program reads an input text file which calculates the total sales tax and the total amount (excluding the sales tax). Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions. After thecharges have been applied, the information is printed to a new text file.
